This application based on Java programming language (13.0.1 version) and Maven (3.8.1 version). I used Javafx (13.0.2 version) to build GUI, especially external libraries, such as:
- javafx-base,
- javafx-controls,
- javafx-fxml,
- javafx-graphics.

This application is a game "Space Race Game". 
The player has four spaceships to choose from. 
The player's task is to avoid meteorites and collect as many stars as possible. 
The more stars a player collects, the more points player gets. 
Collision with the meteor leads to the crash of the spaceship and the end of the game.
